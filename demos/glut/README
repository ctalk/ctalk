GLUT Support in Ctalk
---------------------

Ctalk works with GLUT on Linux/UNIX and Mac OS X platforms.  As usual,
it's necessary to install the Linux or UNIX distribution's GLUT
development packages in order to link programs with GLUT, and the
OpenGL libraries that it uses.

NOTE: GLUT is no longer included in many GNU/Linux distributions. A
free implementation of the GLUT libraries, freeglut, is available at
http://freeglut.sourceforge.net/.

On Macintosh OS X platforms, GLUT is included as an application
framework.  Ctalk doesn't support OS X application frameworks
directly, but it includes the header file, ctalkGLUTdefs.h, which you
can tailor to the system's needs if necessary.  You can include the
GLUT and OpenGL definitions by adding a line like this to the Ctalk
program.

  #include <ctalk/ctalkGLUTdefs.h>

It might be necessary to tailor this file to a specific machine's
configuration - the distribution version is not intended to be definitive,
but to allow extending the API if needed.

Building Executables on Linux/UNIX
----------------------------------

With the standard installation packages, the necessary libraries should
be added to the linker flags during configuration.  That allows you to
build a program as usual.

  $ ctcc -x glutprog.ca -o glutprog

The configuration should also detect a GLUT installation from the
source code when Ctalk is installed, but, again, getting a program to
link with all of GLUT's platform-specific ancillary libraries may
require some editing of the ctcc and ctdb programs.

If the build process produces a link-related error due to a missing
math function, then add -m to the ctcc command line.

  $ ctcc -x -m glutprog.ca -o glutprog

If ./configure for some reason *hasn't* detected the location of GLUT
and its supporting libraries correctly, you can build the programs
manually with a series of commands similar to the following.

    $ ctalk -I /usr/X11R6/include glutprog.ca -o glutprog.i
    $ gcc glutprog.i -o glutprog -lctalk -lreadline -lhistory \
       -L/usr/X11R6/lib -lGL -lGLU -lglut

Again, this example is not meant to be definitive, although you
should be able to modify it for the system's configuration.


Building Executables with OS X (and Darwin)
-------------------------------------------

The OS X/Darwin platform includes support for OpenGL both in the
UNIX configuration and as an application framework.  At least some
OS X distributions include GLUT as an application framework only.

In this case, you can use the ctalkGLUTdefs.h file described above
to add the framework's definitions to a file.

To build an executable, you can also use the OpenGL headers and libraries
that GLUT requires as a UNIX configuration.  To build the example programs,
you might need to use a series of commands like these.

  $ ctalk -I /usr/X11R6/include glutprog.ca -o glutprog.i
  $ gcc -framework GLUT glutprog.i -o glutprog -lctalk -lreadline \
       -L/usr/X11R6/lib -lGL -lGLU

Again, this example is not meant to be definitive.  You might need to
adjust it to the machine's configuration.

Building Ctalk without GLUT
---------------------------

If you don't want your Ctalk installation to support GLUT, add the
--with-glut=no option to configure when building Ctalk; e.g., 

  $ ./configure --with-glut=no
