Ctalk demonstration programs in the ipc subdirectory.

sockread.c
sockwrite.c
           Reader and writer programs that demonstrate
	   how to send and receive data over a UNIX
	   domain socket. After compiling, start
	   sockread at a shell prompt, then start
	   sockwrite from a shell prompt in a
	   different window or virtual terminal.

sockproc.c
           Provides a UNIX domain socket writer and
	   reader in a single program that uses
	   multiple processes.

timeclient.c
timesignal.c
           Timeclient.c installs a signal handler that prints
           the date and time.  Timesignal.c sends a SIGUSR2
           signal to the timeclient process ID (or any other
           process ID).  To build and use these programs,
           see the comments in the source files.

timedisplay.c
	   Another time client/server demonstration, except
	   that the client and the server are in a single
	   program that uses multiple processes.
