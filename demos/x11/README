The programs in this directory demonstrate how to use X11Pane,
X11PaneDispatcher, and its subclasses, which include Ctalk's widget
classes.  The comments at the top of many of the source files provide
some brief instructions about how to build and use the programs.
Instructions for building Ctalk programs in general are in the ctcc(1)
and ctdb(1) manual pages.
