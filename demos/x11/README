The programs in this directory demonstrate how to use X11Pane,
X11PaneDispatcher, and its subclasses.  The comments at the top of
many of the source files provide some brief instructions about how to
build and use the programs.  Instructions for building any of the
programs are in the ctcc(1) and ctdb(1) manual pages.
