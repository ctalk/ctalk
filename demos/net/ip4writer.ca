 *  ip4writer.ca
 *
 *  Writes data to an IPv4 network connection.  Probably the simplest
 *  way to demonstrate this is to start the ip6reader.ca program
 *  (which should be available in the same place as this program)
 *  in a terminal window, and then, in another terminal window,
 *  give this command (if the programs are in the current directory):
 *  
 *    $ ./ip4writer localhost
 *
 *  The Ctalk Reference Manual provides complete information about
 *  the TCPIPV4NetworkStream class and its subclasses.
