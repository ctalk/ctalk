GLX Demonstration Programs

The programs in this directory use the GLXCanvasPane class to display
OpenGL 3 dimensional graphics in a X window.

The programs require that the machine's display server provides
support for GLX visuals.  Most modern Linux, UNIX, and other POSIX
systems with graphical desktops support GLX.  Om most of these
systems, the GLX support can be detected by the Ctalk configuration
and installation process.

On systems with GLX support, the program, glxinfo (1), can display which
GLX visuals the display server provides.

If everything is installed correctly, then you should be able to build
each of these programs using ctcc (1).  For example, to build glx.ca, you
can use a shell command like this.

  $ ctcc -x glx.ca -o glx

Most of the programs use standard OpenGL functions.  The ftfont.ca
program, however, uses shaders via Mesa OpenGL's GLEW_ARB_vertex_shader
and GLEW_ARB_fragment shader.  It also has function calls that support
the GLEW 2.0 application programming interface. but it is presently
untested.
