Ctalk Tests

The following programs test ctalk.

basecls.c    Tests ctalk's base classes.

ctrlstrc.c   Tests ctalk's handling of control structures.

ctypes.c     Tests of C data types.  Note that this test
             only supports the type definitions and library
             quirks of Linux and SunOS.

basiclist.c  Tests Ctalk's handling of basic collections and 
assocarray.c object references.

externs.c    Tests Ctalk's handling of functions and methods 
             in multiple input files.

You can run the tests in this directory by typing, "make test."

Note for GCC Version 7.x

GCC version 7.0.1 adds some new warning messages for string
space and format overflow.  If you want to run the tests without
warning messages using GCC 7.x, use make -f Makefile.gcc7 for
the tests.

Tests for individual features and example programs from the manuals
are in the test/expect directory.  The file test/expect/README
describes them.
