Ctalk Test and Example Programs

Note to GITHUB Users:
--------------------

The github.com distribution of Ctalk does not include the test suite
because of Github's per-directory, 1000-file limit.  The test suite
comprises signifcantly more than 1,000 individual programs and is
still growing. The test and example files that are presented in the
documentation, along with a few other programs, are included in the
subdirectories, however.

The complete test suite is included in the source tarball, which is
available, as always, at:

     http://sourceforge.net/projects/ctalk


The Test Suite
--------------

The cttest shell script in this directory builds and runs test
programs individually.  You can then redirect the output to a file, as
in this example, which runs through all of the test programs.

$ for i in *.c; do echo $i; ./cttest -v $i >>test.out 2>&1; done

Cttest, as configured, tries to get the libraries and compiler flags
right for the system and the compiler, but it may require some
editing, particularly the GCCFLAGS and EXTRALIBS definitions.

Since cttest is generated from cttest.in when building ctalk, the
changes you make to cttest will not be permanent.  It saves a lot
of headaches to store a custom cttest in a directory where it won't
be overwritten or deleted.


Example Program Tests
---------------------

The examples subdirectory contains example programs from the
documentation.  You need to build these first in order to use the 
run-<example-name>.c test programs.  Just type,

$ cd examples
$ for i in *.c; do ctcc $i -o `basename $i .c`; done

There are also example programs from the documentation in the 
examples-x11 subdirectory, and additional tests in the read-tests,
split-tests, x11-tests, and tui subdirectories.

Compiler Options
----------------

The file cttest.in in this directory uses compiler options
that most modern GCC versions recognize.  If this doesn't
work with your version of GCC, then you can either edit the
options and/or live with warning messages in the test output.
