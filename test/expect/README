Ctalk Test and Example Programs

The comments in the scripts and the C source files describe each 
test when necessary.

The cttest shell script in this directory builds and runs test
programs individually.  You can then redirect the output to a file, as
in this example, which runs through all of the test programs.

$ for i in *.c; do echo $i; ./cttest -v $i >>test.out 2>&1; done

Cttest, as packaged, uses the GNU readline libraries.  If you built
Ctalk without GNU readline, then edit the EXTRALIBS variable in cttest
to omit them; i.e., to:

  EXTRALIBS="-lm"

At present, the tests ignore the -Wnonnull warning because of the way
the Ctalk library macros work.  If you want to see these warnings, edit
the GCCFLAGS variable.


Example Program Tests
---------------------

The examples subdirectory contains example programs from the
documentation.  You need to build these first in order to use the 
run-<example-name>.c test programs.  Just type,

$ cd examples
$ for i in *.c; do ctcc $i -o `basename $i .c`; done

There are also example programs from the documentation in the 
examples-x11 subdirectory, and additional tests in the read-tests,
split-tests, x11-tests, and tui subdirectories.

Compiler Options
----------------

The file cttest.in in this directory uses compiler options
that most modern GCC versions recognize.  If this doesn't
work with your version of GCC, then you can either edit the
options and/or live with warning messages in the test output.
