Building the Ctalk Documentation

This directory contains the Ctalk manual pages and documentation.
Autoconf formats and installs the Texinfo manuals and manual pages
automatically.

You can read the Texinfo files with the "info" reader program
or in GNU Emac's *info* directory.

 $ info ./ctalk.info
 $ info ./tutorial.info
 $ info ./ctalktools.info
 $ info ./ctpp.info

To build the text, HTML, versions of the documentation refer to
the makeinfo (1) manual page, which, if it isn't present on the
system, is available as an optional package (look for packages
that say either, "makeinfo" or "texinfo").

To make Postscript and PDF versions of the documentation, you'll need
to have TeX and its associated programs.  Once you have TeX installed,
you can build a PDF version of the tutorial with the following shell
commands (the commands need to be repeated so that TeX can resolve
all of the index and cross reference page numbers accurately).

  $ pdftex tutorial.texi
  $ texindex tutorial.??
  $ pdftex tutorial.texi
  $ texindex tutorial.??
  $ pdftex tutorial.texi
  $ texindex tutorial.??
