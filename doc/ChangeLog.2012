	- In is_c_var_declaration_msg (), checks for
	LABEL token before trying to find existing objects,
	class names, method names, etc.
2012-01-07
	- Removed check for CVAR_ATTR_STRUCT_TYPE_TAG_ATTR
	in get_local_var (), and replaced calls to
	get_local_var () with calls to get_local_struct_defn
	in method_call () and cvar_is_method_receiver ().
	Also did the same with get_global_struct_defn ().
2012-01-09
	- Added TOK_IS_DECLARED_CVAR attribute, set in
	resolve () to avoid repeating a call to
	is_c_var_declaration_msg in parser_pass ().
2012-01-14
	- Added check for assignments in argument lists 
	in rt_expr () in the front end.
	- In resolve, m_actual_method always points to 
	a message sender.  Changed name to m_sender, and
	changed the name of idx_actual_method to sender_idx.
	- Moved instance_vars_from_class_object () to
	primitives.c and made "static inline," because
	it is only used for class member variable 
	definition.  Provisionally removed call to 
	__ctalkFindMemberClass.
2012-01-17
	- Added instantiate_self_object () in object.c and
	call from self_object () and resolve ().  - In
	copy_object_internal_from_parent (),
	(rt_obj.c), if we encounter a circular parent
	reference, where an instance variable references its
	parent object, simply increase the reference count
	of the parent object, instead of trying to duplicate
	the object.
2012-01-18
	- Change for context case for labels following a
	CLOSEBLOCK token in object_context () (rexpr.c).
	- Change to unresolve_eval_delay_warning_2
	(error.c), to reflect the actual classes of the method
	where the warning occurs and the receiver object.
2012-01-19
	- Updates to X11TextPane to use X11Bitmap class
	objects for window buffers.
	- Updates to __ctalkGUIPanePutStr and __xlib_put_str
	(), to only clear the area of the text before
	drawing string, not the entire width of the pane.
	- Added __ctalkX11UseFontBasic function and
	X11Bitmap : font method.
2012-01-20
	- Added __ctalkX11PanePutStrBasic in guiputstr.c.
	- Added X11Bitmap : putStr method.
	- Updated X11TextPane to use the X11Bitmap :
	putStr method.
	- Minor fix in rt_self_expr (rt_expr.c), so that 
	the function returns an expression in some cases
	when a function prototype is missing.
2012-01-21
	- In resolve_arg2 (arg.c) added a warning for 
	a method that shadows an instance variable, except
	for the, "value," instance variable and method.
2012-01-23
	- Changed the, "font," instance variable in
	X11TextPane to, "fontVar," and changed the,
	"fontDesc," instance variable to, "fontDescStr," and
	made changes in x11lib.c and guiputstr.c.
	- Updates to X11TextPane to use X11Bitmap buffers,
	and set the font and background from the pane
	buffers.
	- Release 0.0.97b-20120123.
2012-06-09
	- Added builtins.sh and updated builtin macro configuration 
	from ctpp 1.0.68.  Files updated include builtins.sh, configure.in
	top Makefile.am, ctpp/builtins.c and ctpp/ccompat.c.
2012-06-12
	- Added classes/ctalklib.in and caps.sh to add system-specific
	capabilities to ctalklib.  Added HAVE_GNU_READLINE to ctalklib.
	Added the String::consoleReadLine method, and 
	programs/readlinetest.c
2012-06-13
	- Updated need_rt_eval () (rexpr.c) to handle a case of 
	self <math_op> <c_function>, which gets translated into a simple
	argument call using __ctalk_arg (), etc, instead of 
	__ctalkEvalExpr.
2012-06-15
	- Added ctpp 1.0.69.
2012-06-19
	- Added check for parent object references in 
	__delete_char_ptr_arg () (lib/objtoc.c).
	- Release 0.0.97b 20120619.
