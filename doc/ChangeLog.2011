	- Explicitly set the scope of new class objects to GLOBAL_VAR,
	regardless of where new classes get introduced into
	the program.
	- __have_bitmap_buffers (x11lib.c) checks whether
	the object is the value or parent object.
2011-10-07
	- __ctalk_initLocalObjects (rt_methd.c) checks
	whether a local variable is aliased elsewhere before
	deleting it.  See the note in rt_methd.c.
	- Removed test for valid ASCII character from 
	<< and >> in Character class.
	- Added orig_object_rec to VARENTRY, so we can
	quickly tell if a label has been aliased by another
	object.  Added check to find if local or global
	object is aliased in a method but declared in a
	scope before the current scope.  If it is, then we
	don't delete it when the method's local variables
	get initialized.  Local objects only for now, so
	changes limited to rt_methd.c, rt_obj.c, and
	object.h.
2011-10-08
	- Update exception traces in rt_trace.c and except.c
	to not print __ctblk* methods.
	- Added stack adjustments in become.c for variables when 
	Object : become is called via an inline block.
	- map in List, Array and AssociativeArray classes
	now checks for the last control block argument in
	cases of non-successive recursive calls.
2011-10-14
	- Added is_declared_outside_method in rt_methd.c.
	- Updated X11Pane and X11PaneDispatcher classes to
	use the, "children," list inherited from Pane class 
	for a single sub-pane, and removed the childPane
	instance variable.
2011-10-15
	- Added states in paramstate.h.
2011-10-18
        - Fixed off by one error in argument stack frame for 
        methods called recursively.
2011-10-22
	- Ctpp 1.0.67.
2011-10-26
	- Added is_declared_outside_method in 
	cleanup_reffed_object () in rtnewobj.c.
2011-10-28
	- Added another look for the beginning of the stack
	start when tracking to the beginning of an aggregate
	expression in cvar_is_method_receiver ()
	(resolve.c).
2011-10-29
	- Check for n_args > 0 when deleting method args in
	__ctalk_method () (rt_methd.c).
	- Changed statements that could cause warnings in 
	abs, difftime, strncat, strncmp, and strncpy templates.
2011-11-01
	- Added direct translation for a method return class
	of, "Object," when expression begins with, 
	EVAL_EXPR_FN ("__ctalkEvalExpr"), in 
	obj_2_c_wrapper_trans () (objtoc.c).
	- Constant receiver cleanup in __ctalk_arg () 
	(rt_args.c).
	- Added recurse3.c and recurse4.c test programs.
2011-11-02
	- Added preprocessor #if statements for 
	__SIZEOF_POINTER__ in ANSIYesNoBoxPane,
	ANSIButtonPane, and ANSITerminalPane.
2011-11-03
	- Added a look for class variables in 
	__ctalk_get_object () (rt_obj.c).
2011-11-04
	- Snapshot for 0.0.97b 20111104.
	- Updated signal_handler_basic () in Application
	class to only signal the application's process 
	group.
	- __ctalkX11SetBackground () and X11Pane::background.
2011-11-05
	- Built-in ctpp define __SIZEOF_POINTER__ as 8 on
	x86_64-amd64 machines that define it natively.
	- Added EVAL_STATUS_VAR_REF and check for 
	VAR_REF_OBJECT eval results in __method_arg ().
2011-11-08
	- Added __ctalkGUISetBackground function and X11Pane
	: background method.
	- Added X11Cursor class and grabMove cursor method,
	and useCursor and defaultCursor methods in X11Pane
	class.
2011-11-09
	- Check for an object that is subscripted before
	emitting a warning for multiple subscripts in
	resolve ().
	- Minimum check whether a subscript expression is part of a
	function argument in is_c_var_declaration_msg ().
	- Added another object does not understand message
	warning in resolve ().
2011-11-29
	- Yet more fixes for SPARC in sformat.c.
	- Added primitive_method_call_attr in rt_methd.c and
	rtnewobj.c.  Cleanup in __ctalk_primitive_method and
	new_object for objects that go receive more than one
	"super new" message.
2011-11-29
	- Added X11Bitmap class.
	- Basic functions for creating, deleting, and retrieving X
	Pixmaps and GCs in lib/bitmap.c, X11Bitmap create
	and delete instance methods.  Updated the gui libraries
	use X11Bitmap's	xID instance variable.  
	- Added __ctalkX11Display () and __ctalkX11Colormap 
	library functions, and the xDisplay, xColormap, and 
	classInit class variables in X11Pane class.
2011-12-02
	- __ctalkGUISetBackground now works only for pane
	objects that have actual X windows; e.g., X11Pane 
	objects. Added __ctalkX11SetBackgroundBasic, and 
	__xlib_set_window_background and __xlib_change_gc
	in guisetbackground.c and x11lib.c.
	- Added clear method in X11Bitmap class, and updated 
	the X11CanvasPane clearRectangle method, so both use
	__ctalkX11ClearRectangleBasic. Added the background
	method in X11CanvasPane.
2011-12-03
	- Reworking of X11CanvasPane : subPaneDestroy.
	- Added subPaneNotify message to canvas-dots.c.
	- Added check in eval_expr for instance and class 
	variables and local and global objects shadowing
	each other.  Instance and class variables have
	precedence due to the fact that someone typed the 
	instance or class variable's name immediately after 
	typing its parent object's name, so we can assume
	that's what the program means.
	- Added margexprs24.c and check in eval_expr for 
	the, "eval," keyword.  If, "eval," appears
	*anywhere* in an expression that we've already
	decided needs run-time evaluation, simply elide
	it. Also check if an eval appears as an argument to
	a printf format.
2011-12-05
	- Changed __ctalkGUIPaneRefresh and
	__ctalkX11PaneRefresh to accept the dimensions of
	the source rectangle and destination coordinates as
	arguments.  Also changed the calling arguments for 
	__xlib_refresh_window in x11lib.c.
	- Some basic label checking in rt_self_expr ().
2011-12-06
	- Updated some error messages.
	- Basic grab and move in X11CanvasPane.
	- Updates to X11PaneDispatcher :: subPaneResize.
	- Fix in __ctalkGetClassVariable ().
2011-12-07
	- Minor updates to X11CanvasPane and 
	X11PaneDispatcher, mostly for smoother operation.
	- Added fmt_rt_return_chk_fn_arg to handle a few
	special object-to-C translation cases.
2011-12-10
	- Added guisetforeground.c and
	__ctalkX11SetForegroundBasic () and added a
	foreground GC change in __xlib_change_gc ()
	(guisetforeground.c and x11lib.c).
	- Added X11CanvasPane : foreground method.
	- Use plain old obj_2_c_wrapper in 
	class_variable_expression () (rexpr.c).
	- Extra checking for class variable and method 
	duplication in resolve ().  New version of
	find_class_variable (), added
	is_class_variable_message () (resolve.c and 
	object.c).
2011-12-12
	- Walkback traces now display the names of
	C functions.
2011-12-13
	- Updates to X11TextPane class.  Some of the 
	GUI libraries still need to be incorporated 
	into it.
	- Release 0.0.97b-20111213
2011-12-24
	- self_object () (object.c) no longer adds "self" as
	a local object.  Restricted
	tok_can_begin_var_declaration () (parser.c), to
	check for function names also.
2011-12-27
	- In need_rt_eval (), a dereference or period
	operator with an object expression causes the
	function to return True.
2011-12-28
	- Updated CVAR type in ctalklib to match cvar.h.
	- Added cases in is_c_var_declaration_msg () and 
	fmt_register_c_method_arg_call to handle struct 
	*'s and struct * members.
2011-12-29
	- Added TOK_IS_DECLARED_C_VAR message attribute in
	front end.
	- Added X11CanvasPane : clear method and 
	X11Bitmap : clearRectangle method.
2011-12-30
	- Added warn_unknown_c_type () in error.c, for
	basic_class_from_cvar ().
2011-12-31
	- In __ctalkX11InputClient, added XCheckTypedEvent
	to clear repeated events, and added check for actual
	dimension change for ConfigureNotify events before
	issuing a MOVENOTIFY or RESIZENOTIFY event to 
	X11TerminalStream : queueInput.
