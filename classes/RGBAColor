Integer class RGBAColor
"This class stores colors' red, green, blue, and alpha
components as Integers.  The default format is 24-bit
color, but the Integers' size allows for expansion to
higher resolution color values.  The color's alpha value
is stored as a 16-bit Integer, although finer resolutions
are also possible with a 32-bit Integer. The class 
performs the color lookup and allocation X11 color names, 
from #rrggbb HTML specifications, and can approximate 
display colors from any R,G,B values by using Xlib calls." ;
