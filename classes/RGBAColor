 *    RGBAColor class.
 */

Integer class RGBAColor;
"This class stores colors' red, green, blue, and alpha
components as Integers.  The default format is 24-bit
color, but the Integers' size allows for expansion to
higher resolution color values.  The color's alpha value
is stored as a 16-bit Integer, but finer resolutions are
also possible with this value. The class performs the
color specification from X11 color names, from #rrggbb
HTML specifications, and can approximate display colors
from any R,G,B values by using Xlib calls."
