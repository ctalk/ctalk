Point class Circle

contains the x,y position of the circle's center
and an Integer, which contains its radius.  The class also
defines methods for drawing Circle objects on various X
Windows drawing surfaces. To draw circles in a buffered
window, programs can use the drawCircle method in
X11CanvasPane class.";
