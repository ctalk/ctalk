"This class provides supporting methods for setting and getting
X font information from the X server.  Normally an application
uses the X11Pane : useFont method to set the X Logical Font
Descriptor for the window, or sets the Pane's font instance
variable directly.  Fonts described using XLFDs are listed
using xfontsel(1) and other X utilties.";
