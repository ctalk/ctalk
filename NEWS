What's New in Release 0.0.65 2019-..-..
---------------------------------------

- String : tokenize now collects multi-character math operators
into a single token; e.g. +=, <<, ||.


What's New in Release 0.0.65 2019-11-27
---------------------------------------

- Ctalk is now available on Github.  To retrieve the repository,
type:

  git clone http://github.com/ctalk/ctalk

The most recent Ctalk package is on the, "release," branch.  To use
that branch, type,

  git checkout release

Changes for the next release are in the, "proposed," branch.  To work
with the changes to be included in the next Ctalk package, type,

  git checkout proposed

That means changes for new releases will be available for review and
testing much more quickly - hopefully within a few days after
committing the changes on the development machines.

- The GLXCanvasPane methods extensions and hasExtension use an
internal GLX context, so programs can use the methods without first
creating a window with a GLX context themselves.

- The demonstration program, glxchaserft.ca, in the directory
demos/glx.


What's New in Release 0.0.65 2019-11-12
---------------------------------------

- The GLXCanvasPane class adds support for scalable fonts supported by
the Freetype2 library: FreeType, TrueType, and Type 1; swap
synchronization with the display refresh rate if the machine's OpenGL
version supports the GLX_MESA_swap_control extension; methods that
provide printf style formatting when displaying text, and conversion
of named X11 colors to their OpenGL equivalents.

- Support for some LLVM features, like the __has_include and
__has_include_next preprocessor directives if the host compiler
defines them.


What's New in Release 0.0.65 2019-10-14
---------------------------------------

- This release also adds the ctalkmethods(1) manual page, and a basic
interface for debugging methods and functions which is also a starting
point for examining the Ctalk internals.

- IMPORTANT: Release 0.0.65 contains major changes which significantly
improve programs' run time speed.  It is NOT compatible with previous
Ctalk releases.  If you have applications that were built with earlier
releases, they will need to be rebuilt with this version of the
compiler and libraries.


What's New in Release 0.0.65 2019-08-23
---------------------------------------

- This release also adds MacOS format textures for GLXCanvasPane
windows when using 24-bit colors, as well as internal fixes for
expression analysis and memory leaks.


What's New in Release 0.0.65 2019-08-16
---------------------------------------

- The C library functions that work with UNIX Domain sockets have
been moved to lib/unixsock.c, to improve compatibility across platforms.
The Ctalk library API adds the functions: __ctalkUNIXSocketOpenReader
, __ctalkUNIXSocketOpenWriter, __ctalkUNIXSocketRead, __ctalkUNIXSocketWrite,
and __ctalkUNIXSocketShutdown.  The UNIXNetworkStream class and its
subclasses have been updated to use these functions.  Also, the UNIX domain
API will not be built unless the development headers (sys/socket.h and
sys/un.h) are present on the system.

- The GLXCanvasPane method xpmToTexture, and the glxtexture.ca example
program.


What's New in Release 0.0.64 2019-03-25
--------------------------------------

- X11TextEditorPane objects now support cutting and pasting text
between programs using the X primary selection.

- The X11Pane class now defines the ftFontVar instance variable in
addition to fontVar, so X11Pane subclasses can maintain either of the
font libraries without declaring a separate object for scalable fonts.
The instance variables also allow programs to determine which of either
font library programs have initialized before receiving GUI events.

- Added wrapper functions for libc functions like strcpy, strcat, and
strncpy (xstrcpy, xstrcat, and xstrncpy), etc. The wrapper functions
have standard parameter lists even when a platform compiler replaces
library functions with other (presumably more secure) functions.  Any
library function substitution now occurs internally in the Ctalk
library.

- The installation now stores the browseable class library and C API
documentation in the GNU $pkgdatadir, and the searchlib program has
been updated to look in that directory for the class and library
documentation.  So documentation browsing should just work regardless
of where Ctalk is installed on a system.  This release adds the Object
: docDir method, so new programs can also use this documentation.


Whats New in Release 0.0.63 2018-11-26
--------------------------------------

- The X11TextEditorPane class, which provides basic text editing
functions in a X window.

- The demonstration programs, demos/x11/ctedit.ca and
demos/glx/glxchaser.ca.

- Updated Xft detection of system-wide Fontconfig installations and
cached font information (i.e., a machine's standard font
configuration).

- NOTE: When installing this release, it may be necessary (again)
to rebuild apps, especially gui programs.


Whats New in Release 0.0.62 2018-09-19
--------------------------------------

- The GLXCanvasPane methods useXFont, drawText, drawTextW, freeXFont,
and textWidth, which support drawing text in GLX windows using X
fonts.  Also, the GLXCanvasPane instance variable colormap, which
contains the X resource ID of the window's default colormap. This
facilitates using X color values with OpenGL.

- The GLXCanvasPane demonstration programs, xfonts.ca and
glxexts.ca, in the demos/glx subdirectory.

- Support for the GL Extension Wrangler (libGLEW) library.

- Direct support for the OpenGL data types GLubyte, GLbyte, GLuint,
and GLint.

- The methods Integer : asString, Integer : asDecimalString,
and Integer : asHexString.


Whats New in Release 0.0.62 2018-07-23
--------------------------------------

- This release adds the GLXCanvasPane class and the
demos/glx/glx.ca example program.


What's New in Relase 0.0.62 2018-06-02
--------------------------------------

- This release mainly contains updates for recent GCC releases'
options and warning messages.


What's New in Release 0.0.62 2018-04-23
---------------------------------------

The user visible changes in the 0.0.62 2018-04-23 release include:

- Support for IPv6 socket networking with the classes
TCPIPV6NetworkStream, TCPIPV6NetworkStreamReader, and
TCPIPV6NetworkStreamWriter.  The TCPIPNetworkStreamReader and
TCPIPNetworkStreamWriter classes have been updated to use getaddrinfo
to resolve internet hostnames.

- A new demos/net subdirectory, and the addition of several networking
demonstration programs.

- The String : printMatchToks method, which enables the display of a
regular expression pattern's tokens and the matching text after each
regular expression match.  This information can be useful when
debugging regular expression patterns.

- SortedList class and the methods pushAscending and pushDescending to
manage sorted lists.  The List class adds the methods sortAscending,
sortDescending, sortAscendingByName and sortDescendingByName.

- New methods, including DirectoryStream : sortedDirectoryList, and
String : systemErrnoStr.


What's New in Release 0.0.61 2018-02-27
---------------------------------------

The user visible changes in the 0.0.61 2018-02-27 release include:

- The pattern matching operators now include the '|' metacharacter
which matches one of two alternative patterns.

- The addition of the ctalkregex(1) manual page.

- The methodsource program now correctly handles method names that
contain regular expression metacharacters.

- Compatibility updates for some recent GCC compiler releases.


What's New in Release 0.0.60 2018-01-31
---------------------------------------

The user visible changes in the 0.0.60 2018-01-31 release include:

- The method X11FreeTypeFont : selectFontFromFontConfig supports a
subset of Fontconfig specification tags.  This is in addition to
support for X Logical Font Descriptors and setting font parameters by
setting a X11FreeTypeFont object's instance variables.

- Other new methods in this release include: X11Cursor : arrow, String
: isXLFD, and X11TextPane : deleteText.  The methods Object : == and
Object : != now check for object identity; whether the receiver and
the argument are the same object.

- For the X11Pane class and its subclasses, compatibility updates for
the Cinnamon, Compiz, Enlightenment, Cairo Dock, Pantheon, Xfce, and
other window managers.

- Writeback of scalar C variables (ints, long ints, and long
long ints).  This updates a C variable correctly when an expression
uses an increment or decrement method (++ or --) with the variable.

- NOTE: There are several changes in the library's virtual method
calling mechanism, so programs that use callbacks (these are mainly
programs that use X11Pane graphics classes and subsclasses), should
be recompiled in order to work correctly.  Other programs may need
to be recompiled also.

What's New in Release 0.0.59 2017-07-18
---------------------------------------

- Added the TCPIPNetworkStream, TCPIPNetworkStreamReader, and
TCPIPNetworkStreamWriter classes, which provide methods that create
client and server internet connections, and peer-oriented connections
on supported platforms.

What's New in Release 0.0.58 2017-04-28
---------------------------------------

- Added UNIXNetworkStream : removeSocket, so closing a socket (by
using UNIXNetwordStream : closeSocket) and removing a socket
permanently are two separate operations.  Also,
UNIXNetworkStreamWriter : open adds a separate check for a socket
file's existence.

- Compatibility with GCC 7.

- The --warnunresolvedselfexpr and --verbose command line options.
--warnunresolvedselfexpr prints a warning if the, "self," keyword
appears in an expression, mainly within argument blocks, that can't
be resolved until run time.  The --verbose option is a synonym for
-v.


What's New in Release 0.0.58 2017-03-10
----------------------------------------

The user visible changes in the 0.0.58 2017-03-10 release include:

- The "+" regular expression metacharacter, which matches one or more
occurences of the character that immediately precedes it.

- The X11Bitmap : drawPoint and X11Bitmap : drawLine methods, which
facilitate drawing graphics in offscreen buffers.

What's New in Release 0.0.58 2107-01-03
----------------------------------------

The user visible changes in the 0.0.58 2017-01-03 release include:

- The method Object : backgroundMethodObjectMessage, which starts a
method as a background process.  The process exits when the method
returns.

- Added the NetworkStream class and its subclasses: UNIXNetworkStream,
UNIXNetworkStreamReader, and UNIXNetworkStreamWriter.  These classes
provide interprocess communication facilities via UNIX domain
sockets.

- New methods in the SignalHandler class, including SignalHandler :
waitStatus, which reports the status of a child process.

- The graphics library now supports drawing Point objects using the X
Render extension if it is available.  There's also a new release of
the timepieces package, which contains minor compatibility updates.

- The programs subdirectory has been renamed to demos, and
there is a new directory, demos/ipc, which contains examples
of interprocess communication using signals and UNIX sockets.

- Yet more changes in X11PaneDispatcher class to support parent window
references.  This may require that some GUI programs need to be
recompiled.

What's New in Release 0.0.57 2106-12-02
----------------------------------------

The user visible changes in the 0.0.57 2016-12-02 release include:

- An updated X11TextPane class, and the x11textpane.c and
displaytext.c demonstration programs in the programs subdirectory.
The Ctalk library functions __ctalkSplitText and __ctalkWrapText
perform line wrapping and filling.  The X11TextPane class also has new
keyboard commands to move around the text, and supports basic markup
tags.

- Loading a X11Font or X11FreeTypeFont now loads the font's common
typefaces; i.e., the font's regular, bold, italic, and bold italic
variants.  Programs can switch between the typefaces with the methods
faceRegular, faceBold, faceItalic, and faceBoldItalic, which are
defined in X11TextPane and X11Bitmap classes.  These methods call the
__ctalkSelectXFontFace library function to perform the typeface
selection.

- Application class now provides the spawnC method, which allows
programs to launch other programs as daemon processes and continue
executing while the background process is running.

- The regular expression parser now supports the Perl-style character
classes \W \d \x \p \l and \w.

- CalendarTime class now includes the cTimeString, isoTimeString,
and zoneInfo methods, and the instance variables haveDst, timeZone,
tzStd, tzDst, and gmtOff.

- The X11Pane : container instance variable is now a Symbol object,
which allows for easier access to upper level panes from several
subpane levels below them.  Note that this can be incompatible with
earlier builds of the Ctalk apps that use the X11* classes.  If a
graphical app suddenly seems not to display something, rebuilding the
program with this Ctalk release builds the app with the updated X11*
classes.


What's New in Release 0.0.57 2106-10-14
----------------------------------------

The user visible changes in the 0.0.57 2016-10-14 release include:

- Constructor methods (i.e., "new") can now create multiple
objects from a list of object names; e.g.;

   String new myStr1, myStr2, myStr3;
   
- Support for the Perl-style string match operators =~ and !~, and
methods in String class that check for matching and non-matching
strings.

- The regular expression parser can now store the text and position
of any part of a string that it matches (i.e., "backreferences").
String class adds the methods, matchAt and matchIndexAt, which retrieve
this information after a call to matchRegex, =~, !~, and other
methods.

- A new pattern constant type, which uses only the regular expression
parser to interpret the the pattern's regular expression(s) when
matching text.  This makes writing patterns less cumbersome.  For
example, while a string that contains a pattern that escapes
metacharacters might look like this:

  "(.\\*)\\(.*\\)"

the equivalent pattern would be:

  /(.\*)\(.*\)/

A pattern is delimited by slashes (//) or a delimiter preceded by a
'm' character.  To match the regular expression '\*', you could use
these character sequences.

String        Pattern     Alternate Pattern
"\\\\*"       /\\*/       m|\\*|


- In GLUTApplication class, textures may now have an application
defined alpha channel, which allows programs to use transparency and
alpha blending in textures.  The release also adds the texblend.ca
example program in the programs/glut subdirectory.

- The method, Application : installPrefix, now provides the name
of the top-level directory where Ctalk is installed.

- The searchlib utility now uses the new LibrarySearch class to
perform its searches, and adds the ability to search for method
prototypes in the class library documentation.  The latest release of
the Ctalk browser for Emacs also adds support for class library
searches.

- The method, Application : execC, which executes a subprocess and can
either display the subprocesses' standard output (which may be
redirected), or save the subprocesses' standard output in a String
object.



What's New in Release 0.0.56 2106-09-09
----------------------------------------

The user visible changes in the 0.0.56 2016-09-09 release include:

- Top-level argument blocks can now contain, "return," statements, and
the compiler can recognize the difference between a, "break," keyword
used as an exit from an argument block loop and a, "structural break,"
like the breaks that end, "case," statements.

- The Xrender drawing routines now use color caching independent of
the X server, which allows programs to look up colors without making a
trip to the server.

- The CalendarTime class, which provides a generally more efficient
way to store time and date information than CTime class.  The apps in
newest release of the Timepieces package use CalendarTime class to run
more efficiently.

- The ctdb and ctcc programs support the -c (compile only) option, and
the compiler has more thorough error checking of complex expressions.

- The Ctalk Wiki release 0.0.04 adds support for file uploads and
convenience features like page cookies and file inclusion.


What's New in Release 0.0.56 2106-08-16
----------------------------------------

The user visible changes in the 0.0.56 2016-08-16 release include:

- Circle class, which defins instance data for circles, and methods
that can render the circles on Various X Window System drawing
surfaces. Also added the X11CanvasPane : drawCircle method, which
draws circles in buffered windows.

- Transparent support for the X Render extension.  Supports
antialiasing and compositing (via alpha blending) in the graphics
library, if the machine's X server supports X Render.  The useXRender
method, defined in Application and X11Pane classes, allows programs to
override the system's selection of drawing application programming
interface and still use the Xlib API if necessary.

- Related to the previous item, Pen class now defines an, "alpha,"
instance variable, which allows Pen objects to define the complete X
Render RGBA color specification.

- The X11CanvasPane : copy and directCopy methods, which copy
X11Bitmap objects to the receiver X11CanvasPane object or the parent
X11Pane object.  This facilitates storing graphics offscreen and
displaying them via the copy mechanism as needed.

- Added the X11Font : textWidth method.

- Added X11FreeTypeFont : namedX11Color method, which translates
between X color names and Xft/XRender colors, and the methods, red,
green, blue, and alpha, which allow programs to set each RGBA color
channel individually.

- Added convenience features to some of the drawing routines:
Overloaded X11Bitmap : putStr and X11CanvasPane putStrXY methods allow
programs to specify directly the font and text color to render the
text for each method call.  X11FreeTypeFont : selectFont now returns
SUCCESS or ERROR (an Integer) to indicate if the font selection
succeeded. Also added the X11Pane : displayWidth and X11Pane :
displayHeight methods, which return the size of the X display in
pixels.

- The X11TerminalStream class now has an eventMask instance variable,
which allows programs to select only the window system events they
want to receive, which can greatly improve program's response.

- Updates in the analysis of mixed C/Ctalk expressions, and better
support for typecasts in mixed expressions.  C typecasts can in many
causes perform an on-the-fly conversion from one class to another.
Generally better flexibility in mixing C functions with Ctalk terms in
the same expression.
