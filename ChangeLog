	- Added a check for a lval from a typedef in rt_self_expr
	(src/rt_expr.c).
2021-01-02
	- Added the struct[4-5].c test programs.
	- Added an extra check for a valid CVAR in
	get_global_var (cvars.c).
	- Added get_struct_by_type (cvars.c), and also added
	a check for an lval from an incomplete typedef in
	rt_self_expr (src/rt_exor.c).
	- Added struct[6-7].c test programs.
2021-01-03
	- Added extract_argblk_name_from_subexpr (substrcpy.c).
	- Updated super_c_argument_context_handler to handle
	lvalues in argument blocks which typedef'd struct
	members (argblk.c).
	- Added struct8.c test program.
2021-01-07
	- Updated c_param_expr_arg to check for an expression that
	contains a paramenter's instance variable.
2021-01-10
	- Added the TOK_HAS_CVARTAB_AGG_WRAPPER message attribute
	(message.h), set in argblk_cvar_is_fn_argument for CVAR tokens
	in argument blocks that have a following '.' token, and checked
	in fmt_c_fn_obj_args_expr.  Also updated fmt_c_fn_obj_args_expr
	to work with multiple complex arguments (arg.c). Also increment
	the struct member(s)' evaled token, so resolve knows that they've
	already been evaluated when it reads struct members without
	recognizing the wrapped struct basename (arg.c).
2021-01-11
	- Added the String : eval method.
2021-01-12
	- Updated parse to check for another closing block case when
	updating the control block state (parser.c).
2021-01-13
	- Added the demos/x11/popupmenu.ca demo program, basic version.
	- Cleaned up the X11LabelPane logic that initializes the
	borderWidth instance variable from the classes' "borderWidth"
	resource.  Also added the initialized instance variable to
	X11LabelPane.
