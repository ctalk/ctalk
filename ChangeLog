2021-01-01
	- Added a check for a lval from a typedef in rt_self_expr
	(src/rt_expr.c).
2021-01-02
	- Added the struct[4-5].c test programs.
	- Added an extra check for a valid CVAR in
	get_global_var (cvars.c).
	- Added get_struct_by_type (cvars.c), and also added
	a check for an lval from an incomplete typedef in
	rt_self_expr (src/rt_exor.c).
	- Added struct[6-7].c test programs.
2021-01-03
	- Added extract_argblk_name_from_subexpr (substrcpy.c).
	- Updated super_c_argument_context_handler to handle
	lvalues in argument blocks which typedef'd struct
	members (argblk.c).
	- Added struct8.c test program.
2021-01-07
	- Updated c_param_expr_arg to check for an expression that
	contains a paramenter's instance variable.
2021-01-10
	- Added the TOK_HAS_CVARTAB_AGG_WRAPPER message attribute
	(message.h), set in argblk_cvar_is_fn_argument for CVAR tokens
	in argument blocks that have a following '.' token, and checked
	in fmt_c_fn_obj_args_expr.  Also updated fmt_c_fn_obj_args_expr
	to work with multiple complex arguments (arg.c). Also increment
	the struct member(s)' evaled token, so resolve knows that they've
	already been evaluated when it reads struct members without
	recognizing the wrapped struct basename (arg.c).
2021-01-11
	- Added the String : eval method.
2021-01-12
	- Updated parse to check for another closing block case when
	updating the control block state (parser.c).
2021-01-13
	- Cleaned up the X11LabelPane logic that initializes the
	borderWidth instance variable from the classes' "borderWidth"
	resource.  Also added the initialized instance variable to
	X11LabelPane.
	- Updated X11LabelPane : __drawJustified to do a line width
	measurement independently after selecting the receiver label's
	font, so the method doesn't use the incorrect metrics when
	dealing with multiple labels/fonts.  Updated __drawJustified's
	prototype to omit the text width metric that had been passed into
	the method
	- Updated __ctalkXftGetStringDimensions to check for a dialog
	display record and use it if present (xftlib.c).
2021-01-14
	- Added the __ctalkXftTextDimensionsBasic library function
	(xftlib.c), and the X11FreeTypeFont methods, textWidthBasic and
	textHeightBasic.
2021-01-15
	- In X11TextEntryPane : subPaneKbd, use List : pop to
	remove the last character when the selection includes the
	end of the entry, or List : delete if the selection begins
	at the start of	the text.
2021-01-16
	- Updated __ctalkXftInitLib to fill in the selected_font
	parameters from the result of trying to load system-defined
	default fonts when library is first initialized (xftlib.c).
	- Updated the X11CanvasPane : attachTo methods to fill in
	the pane's ftFontVar instance variables with the parameters
	of the currently selected font.
	- Added the X11FreeTypeFont : style instance variable.
2021-01-17
	- Added sync_ft_font calls in xftlib.c after each
	XftFontOpen call.
	- Updated X11LabelPane : selectFont to make its ftFontVar
	values the current font.
2021-01-18
	- X11ButtonPane updates for more modularized font handling.
	- Added X11ButtonPane : configureFonts to localize setting
	the label subpane's font.  Also changed the resource key
	to "font" so it's consistent with other classes' name for
	the font resource, although the method also recognizes the
	older "ftFont" key if the program uses it.
2021-01-19
	- In load_ft_font_faces_internal, integrated the font stash
	lookup better with the call to XftFontOpen if needed (xftlib.c).
	- Removed the separate font parameter state for the font selected
	for rendering on the server side (i.e., the parameters used by
	new_font_spec and save_new_font_spec (xftlib.c) and sync_ft_font
	(i.e., the __ctalkXftRequested* functions) (xlibfont.c).
	- Updated X11FreeTypeFont : __loadInfo to use the __ctalkXftSelected*
	library functions instead of the __ctalkXftRequested* functions.
2021-01-20
	- Added sync_ft_color, used internally by
	__ctalkXftSetForegroundColorFromNamedColor (xlibfont.c).
	- Updated __ctalkXftTextDimensionsBasic to work with
	dialog windows.
2021-01-21
	- Added the __ctalkX11MenuDrawLine library function (xmenu.c).
	- Updated __ctalkX11CreatePopupMenu (xmenu.c), and
	X11PopupMenu : popup to use the "bgColor" resource to set
	the menu's background color.
2021-01-22
	- Added fmt_rt_argblk_super_expr, added by rt_expr
	(rt_expr.c).
2021-01-24
	- Updated handle_cvar_argblk_translation to handle more
	that just OBJECT *'s when wrapping struct members
	(cvartab.c).
	- Added the addition of the TOK_HAS_CVARTAB_AGG_WRAPPER
	to C variable tokens in fmt_rt_argblk_super_expr (rt_expr.c).
	Also added an aggregate_end_idx parameter to
	handle_cvar_argblk_translation (cvartab.c).
2021-01-26
	- Added method_arg_is_argblk_struct (arg.c), called
	by fmt_rt_argblk_super_expr (rt_expr.c).
2021-01-28
	- In resolve, look for a prefix operator starting an
	object expression in parens, and output it directly
	(resolve.c).
	- Added the demos/x11/popupmenu.ca demo program, basic version.
2021-01-29
	- Added the X11LabelPane lineHeight and parHeight instance
	variables.
2021-01-30
	- Added X11CanvasPane methods drawRectangle, drawRoundedRectangle,
	drawFilledRectangle, and drawFilledRoundedRectangle with an
	additional Pen argument, which contains the color and line
	width used for drawing.
	- Added the X11CanvasPane instance variables borderPen,
	scrollBorderPen, and selectionPen.
2021-01-31
	- Added the X11LabelPane boldFont instance variable and
	resource.
	- Added dialog compatibility to __ctalkSelectXFontFace
	(xlibfont.c).
2021-02-01
	- Added the X11CanvasPane : selectFont methods.
2021-02-02
	- Release 0.66 2021-02-02.
2021-02-04
	- Removed an unneeded background method call in	X11CanvasPane :
	attachTo.
	- Updated __ctalkX11InputClient to handle recent XFCE resizing
	event protocols (x11lib.c).
